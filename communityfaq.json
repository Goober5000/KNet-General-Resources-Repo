            {
                "Question":"What order should I play FSO mods in?",
                "Answer":"Freespace Port (Freespace 1) and Freespace 2 are a good place to start, since they are designed to be accessible to new players and have good training missions.  After that we recommend asking the community on our discord.  We can provide recommendations based on what type of campaign you want to play."

                "Question":"Can I play as a capital ship?",

            {
                "Question":"Why are there so many controls?  Do I need to learn all of them?  Why do some mods not have all of them?",
                "Answer":"As an older PC simulation game, there are a lot of controls that were added to allow players to play with different play styles.  You do not need to learn all of the controls, but knowing more of the targeting controls, communication shortcuts, and power transfer controls can help when playing on higher difficulties.  Mods can disable unneeded controls to simplify gameplay."

                "Answer":"Missions can be created in Fred, our mission editor, and hopefully in the future with qtFRED.  The mission file is also in text format, so experienced mission creators can make edits to existing missions by hand, when needed."

                "Answer":"First of all, with scripting all things are possible, so write that down. There are some mods with ground levels or levels with a planet landscape, but they generally require much more work to finish."

            {
                "Question":"What are FSO’s animation and video file formats?",
                "Answer":".mve .msb .ogg .mp4 .srt .webm .png (apng) are all valid video files for FSO. We support apng files if their extension is .png.  .eff can also be used and is a special kind of 'animation' format which uses a set of regular images and a text file to create an animation."
            },
